Internationalization in Angular

- `/hot-towel/` is a clean slate, generated hot-towel Angular SPA that can be used to follow along with my course: [Play by Play: Angular Internationalization with John Papa and Brian Clark](http://jpapa.me/pbpi18nclark)
- `/hot-towel-done/` is the completed hot-towel Angular SPA that resulted from the Play by Play course.
